I would add the following as issues but your repo doesn't allow that:

# The Building your Designs Page

- check What to do to the Makefile if using SystemVerlog or not using XDL?  Need to tell how.

- check Are there suggestions/restrictions on where your design files can be put?  If it doesn't matter, could still say so.

- Add the programming of the board to the Makefile.  I assume it would be simple 1-liner.  I would add it but I have no way of testing it on my system.

# The Makefiles Page

- Still have a question on whether there are multiple Makefiles in symbiflow-examples or just one?  Also, is the one you provided to the users in the prior tutorial page taken from symbiflow-examples or did you create it from scratch?   If it comes from symbiflow-examples (which I assume it did) then tell where it came from so people know where to get it from if they want a copy in the future.
